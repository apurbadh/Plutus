        | - 'url' => env('APP_URL').'/uploads';

        | 2. Verify if the /storage/uploads directory exists and if not, create it with a .gitignore file inside.
        |
        | 3. Run the command: "php artisan varbox:uploads-link", to create a symlink between the storage and public directories.
